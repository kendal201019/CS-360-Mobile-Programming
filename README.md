This app addresses user needs of keeping track of weights in order to aid them in a weight loss journey. The goal of this project was to create an app that allowed an user to log-in securely, set goal weights, daily weights, as well as receive notifications when users were approaching their goal weight. 

The required screens were:
  1) Log In screen: allows a user to access the app, or create an account to access the app
  2) Dashboard: displays recent weights, goal weight, as well as has buttons to set goal weights, and daily weights

To code this app we starting with identifying user needs and specifications. Then we designed the layout of the app. Once approved with began coding the app in small modules in order to test as we went along. 

To test the code was functional we tried creating different usernames and passwords, we tested the dashboard but inputing different characters to ensure everything worked as intended. 

Where I had to innovate to meet a challenge was in the final phase of the developement process, or the coding stage. This is where the whole project came together. Being my first time building an app, there was a lot of hurdles to overcome with a lot of research. 

The design stage is where I believe I performed at my strongest. In the future, I would like to work on the coding side of things.
